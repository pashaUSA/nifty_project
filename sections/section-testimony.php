                            <p>While I was in Mycenae, Greece on a Nifty Tour, our group came upon a cistern -- an ancient, long, dark underground storage area, that, legend has it, was the one Orestes hid in after he'd killed his mother, Clytemnestra. Even though our tour guide warned against it, I descended the icy steps to see what was inside.

                                <br> About halfway, I fell, crashing down to the cistern bottom. I didn't break anything, but I believe I strained my orestes. I was eventually able to crawl out of that deadly hole as my co-tourees took pictures. It's an exciting memory they'll never forget! Personally, I repressed the trauma. </p>
